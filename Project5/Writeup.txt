# CS478 Development of Mobile Apps (Android) 2019 Spring Project 5
First run ClipServer, to compile the program since it does not have main interface you should change Run>EditConfigurations>AndroidApp>App change Launch Options to “Nothing” initially it is set to “Default Activity”.
Then run AuctioClient sometimes when you run first time the app closes but when you run it again, it works as intended.
